# Proficiency

---

## Description

Proficiency is a social media platform and a tool for tradespeople, creators, artists, and more to collaborate and share things they've done in their profession.
My motivation for creating this project stems from my career as a construction professional always in need of a place to save and share all the places I have built.
Users of Proficiency could also be artists sharing locations of all the murals they've done, or a road pavers wanting to display all the roads they've paved.
